# Why Are We Building This?

Most internet companies use spreadsheets or databases to address their business needs. Every day, over a billion people collaborate using spreadsheets. However, working with databases at a similar level of efficiency is still a long way off, despite databases being far more powerful computational tools. Relying on SaaS solutions for this purpose introduces issues like restrictive access control, vendor lock-in, data lock-in, sudden price changes, and, most importantly, the potential "glass ceiling" of capabilities in the future.

# Our Mission

Our mission is to create the most powerful no-code interface for databases and open-source it for every internet company worldwide. This will not only make this powerful computational tool accessible to everyone, but it will also empower a billion or more people to innovate and build aggressively on the internet.
